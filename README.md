# Project Title

CrewMate is a website that provides an employee management system (EMS) for businesses and organizations to manage their employees. This website contains personal information such as names, employee IDs, emails, contact information, as well as information related to job roles.

My website now has a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) implementation concept, however it is not yet functioning due to a lack of PHP and database components. So don't be surprised if you can login without entering anything in the login field.
